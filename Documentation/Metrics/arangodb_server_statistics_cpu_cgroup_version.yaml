  Indicates which cgroup version was detected on the system at startup:
  - 0: No cgroup support detected
  - 1: cgroup v1 (legacy) detected
  - 2: cgroup v2 (unified hierarchy) detected
  
  This metric is useful for understanding whether container resource limits
  (CPU quotas) can be detected by ArangoDB. Systems with cgroup support
  typically report more accurate CPU core counts when running in containers.
