description: |
  Number of follower shards on this machine that are not in sync with their leader.
  This is the follower-perspective counterpart to arangodb_shards_out_of_sync, which
  reports from the leader's perspective. A follower shard is out of sync when it has
  not caught up with the latest data from its leader.
troubleshoot: |
  If this metric shows a non-zero value for an extended period, it indicates that
  some follower shards on this DBServer are lagging behind their leaders. This could be due to:
  - Network issues between this DBServer and the leaders
  - This DBServer being overloaded or slow
  - Large amounts of data being replicated

  Investigate the replication logs and check the server's resource utilization.
  If the problem persists, contact ArangoDB customer support.
