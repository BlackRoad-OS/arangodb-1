  Number of follower shards on this machine. Every shard has a leader and
  potentially multiple followers. This metrics should be equal to the number of

troubleshoot: |
  This metric is used to track the number of follower shards on this machine.
  It is calculated as the difference between the total number of shards and the
  number of leader shards.
  If this metric is not equal to the difference between the total number of shards and the
  number of leader shards, then something is wrong. Please contact ArangoDB customer support.
